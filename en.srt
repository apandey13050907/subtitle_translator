hello grammarians today we're going to
be talking about the irregular plural

2
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:09,087
previously I had said that if you take
any English word any noun say the word

3
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:15,175
dog and you tackiness onto the end of it
like so you get the word dogs and that's

4
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:23,075
how you form the plural in all cases I
was lying sorry it turns out that

5
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:25,138
English is a little bit more complicated
than that

6
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:31,076
while adding an S two things is the way
you usually make things plural sometimes

7
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:35,035
there are other changes and sometimes
you don't even paralyzed using an S at

8
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,940
the end but we're not gonna talk about
that now that's for another time but i

9
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:43,167
wanna talk about today is the most basic
kind of irregular plural so we have the

10
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:56,102
difference in English between regular
and irregular plurals and remember a

11
00:00:57,002 --> 00:01:02,451
plural is when there's more than one of
something that comes from the Latin plus

12
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:15,610
which means as opposed to the singular
when there is just one of something

13
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:22,088
you know 11 dog two dogs so there's a
handful of words in English and it

14
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:32,088
really is a handful that don't plural
eyes regularly words like leaf loaf calf

15
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:37,437
cowboy if you try to play realized these
as though they were irregular plurals

16
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:42,770
you're going to return something that is
not correct or at least is not

17
00:01:42,077 --> 00:01:47,130
conventional within modern standard
American English right so Leafs for

18
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:52,062
example unless you're talking about the
Toronto hockey team is not correct in

19
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,172
fact the proper term

20
00:01:54,072 --> 00:02:04,171
boop boop boop is in fact leaves it is
not low but tasty loaves of bread it is

21
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:11,132
not calf's but cash so there are several
different kinds of irregular plurals

22
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,041
that's why this video is called the part
1 but I'm only going to cover one such

23
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:23,048
irregular plural today and that is the
change from Cingular F to plural ve so

24
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:30,111
if you see a word generally that ends in
F the plural is going to become ve you

25
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:32,032
can learn anything

26
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:32,067
